# Changelog

## 0.1.5 - 2026-03-15

- Restored the interactive framework and evidence graph canvas so the generated tree views are no longer reduced to plain HTML lists.
- Reintroduced the shared hierarchy renderer and model layer that powers zoom, drag, hover, and side-panel inspection for tree outputs.
- Updated release-facing CI and repository templates to validate against the canonical pipeline instead of the removed strict-mapping commands.

## 0.1.4 - 2026-03-14

- Rebuilt the extension against the final four-layer runtime and canonical output.
- Switched release-facing validation guidance to `scripts/validate_canonical.py`.
- Revalidated the repository end-to-end and rebuilt the VSIX from the validated workspace.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-03-14

- Removed the repository-side `knowledge_base_basic` release payloads so public releases stay focused on the Shelf AI extension.
- Tightened the release policy to state that `knowledge_base_basic` is only a local validation sample and must not be published as a standalone versioned deliverable.
- Repackaged and reinstalled Shelf AI `0.1.3` so the shipped VSIX matches the validated workspace and release policy.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-03-14

- Synced the extension with the four-layer runtime and canonical-derived tree views.
- Updated release-facing documentation to use the current canonical naming consistently.
- Repackaged and reinstalled the VSIX against the current workspace so the publishable asset matches the validated repository state.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-03-14

- Fixed Shelf validation defaults to use the supported `validate_canonical.py` commands instead of passing stale arguments.
- Added runtime command normalization so existing user settings with the stale `--json` flag still run successfully.
- Synced the extension README and tests with the supported validation command contract to prevent the mismatch from reappearing.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-03-14

- Raised the extension version to `0.1.0` to match the repository-wide architecture rewrite instead of treating it as another `0.0.x` patch.
- Kept the extension aligned with the rewritten mainline:
  `Framework -> Config -> Code -> Evidence`.
- Kept project navigation, auto-materialization, generated-artifact guarding, and validation centered on `projects/*/project.toml` and canonical-derived views.
- Fixed configured-framework inference to read `[[framework.modules]]` directly from the unified config layout.
- Updated repository docs to point at the current pipeline entrypoint and mark the rewrite execution ledger as complete so extension-facing guidance matches the shipped architecture.

## 0.0.48 - 2026-03-14

- Rebased Shelf AI on the rewritten repository architecture:
  `Framework -> Config -> Code -> Evidence`.
- Switched project navigation from the removed dual-track config path to unified `projects/*/project.toml`.
- Switched generated-artifact guarding and auto-materialization to discovered `project.toml` files.
- Dropped extension-side dependence on removed legacy project scaffolding assumptions.
- Clarified that `projects/*/generated/canonical.json` is the sole machine truth and all evidence views are derived from it.
